Here, we need to carry out a need-finding, and an analysis must be conducted to verify the 
legitimacy of the issues with the interface.
Need Finding:
Understanding user needs and identifying the problem space are essential steps in the interface 
redesign process for Splitwise. Need-finding involves assessing the strengths and weaknesses 
of the current interface and discerning the needs and expectations of its users. User types 
interacting with the Splitwise interface include individuals, roommates, friends, and groups 
managing shared expenses. The problem space for this redesign encompasses shared expense 
management, emphasizing the ease of use and efficiency for users.
To gather insights for interface redesign, we plan to conduct two forms of need-finding: 
interactive and passive. Interactive need-finding will involve surveys and observations with 
users of varying technical proficiency and familiarity with finance management. This will help 
us understand accessibility concerns and user preferences better. Additionally, we will analyze 
usage logs and user reviews for passive need-finding, aiming to identify common issues users 
encounter and frequently used features.
Our focus will be on creating an interface that addresses the diverse needs of Splitwise users, 
ensuring a positive user experience and efficient expense management for individuals and 
groups alike.
